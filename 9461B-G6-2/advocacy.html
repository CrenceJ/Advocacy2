                    <p>Saint Louis University established Center for Culture and the Arts (CCA) in 1993 during the presidency of Fr. Joseph Van den Daelen, who believed that in addition to providing quality education, SLU should also be a place where art is not only appreciated and nurtured but where our cultural heritage is preserved and perpetuated,the main purpose of CCA is to preserve and develop cultural heritage.They Develop the potential of students to  those who can perform.They build different performing art groups like TANGHALAN, so that they can showcase the Philippine culture and SLU culture, like they do concert/performance, they insert Philippine cultural, they give their best skills and talent as a student. It's a great way of preserving the cultural heritage. Other group like CCPG (Cordilleran Group) they preserve the culture by traditional dance. They invite in event to present the dance tradition(Kanyaw).</p>

Indeed, through the years, CCA remains a significant venue for the education and training of artists and as a seat of exploring and experiencing the arts.Center for Culture and the Arts will continue to render its share towards a new dawn of creativity and artistic excellence.</p>
